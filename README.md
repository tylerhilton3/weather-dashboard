# Overview

This is a simple WebApp I made to learn more about how API's are integrated into JavaScript and react, as well as how to generate html dynamically.

# Web Pages

Theres two webpages I used in this project:
* I have a home page that shows you the weather in certain hotspots around the world, like Los Angeles, Tokyo, and New York.
* I have a page that displays the weather of cities the user searches

# Development Environment

I used a node server with React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS

# Future Work

* CSS needs improved to make the UI more pretty
* Potentially using the open weather API to get news on different weather events.
* Making the search bar activate when you hit enter.
